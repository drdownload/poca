# About #

**poco,-a**: `adjetivo` not much, little (example: "_tengo poco apetito_")

Poca is a command line podcast aggregator/client, written in Python. It is a solid, capable program, that in the best `*`NIX tradition attemps to ["do one thing and do it well"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#McIlroy:_A_Quarter_Century_of_Unix).

Functionality-wise, the focus is - as the name hints at - to reign in its appetite: Subscribing to a feed should not simply be downloading each new episode until the harddrive is groaning under the weight, rather it should mean having the latest episodes available while old ones are discarded. This is done by specifying the amount of disk space allocated to each feed.

As for user interface and design, Poca is intended to be a powerful and easy-to-use podcast tool (also in the `*`NIX spirit) rather than pre-molded podcast package. This leaves extensive options in the hands of the user, including id3 tagging, cronjob compatibility, error logging prefs, etc.

Poca is being actively developed as of February 2011.
